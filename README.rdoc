== SIGTOOL

This is a tool that parses and stores scan results from the Probe Scanner interface of EVE Online.
It uses the IGB trust, and based on the HTTP Headers sent by the IGB stores the Solar System in which the scan took place.

SIGTOOL uses a part of the CCP Static Data Dump, namely: Systems, Constellations and Regions.
